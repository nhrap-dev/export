# hazus_export_report

The Hazus Export & Report Utility summarizes Hazus risk assessment results stored on your desktop Hazus database in a handful of text files, shapefiles, and a one-page graphic report. Install the required Python environment and launch the utility directly from the Hazus Utility Toolkit interface.

## To Use

* Select a scenario from those stored in your desktop Hazus database, listed in the drop-down menu
* Name the report file - you will be able to change the report title later
* Select the types of summaries you want - text files, shape files, and/or a pdf report
* Select a location for exports and the report
